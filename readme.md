# The C Programming Language

This repo holds the code written while reading "The C Programming Language", Second Edition, by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

I burned out during Chapters 7 and 8, especially when I realized that syscalls.h was not readily available to me for use. I may come back sometime in the future to tackle a few exercises in 7 and 8, but for now, I am quite happy with what I have learned about programming in C.
